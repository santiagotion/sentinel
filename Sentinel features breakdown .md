Protecting Truth, Strengthening Unity in the DRC

Metadata


Overview

In today’s interconnected world, a single tweet, a fabricated broadcast, or one false headline can spread instantly. Such incidents can unsettle communities, fuel conflict, and erode trust in public institutions. These threats to national cohesion remind us that in the twenty-first century, nations are not defended by borders alone but also by the integrity of the narratives that define them.

For the Democratic Republic of Congo, this reality elevates information oversight from a technical issue to a matter of national stability, democratic legitimacy, and sovereignty itself. The state remains the ultimate guarantor of truth for its citizens, and with this responsibility comes the need for tools equal to the challenges of our era.

Sentinel fully shares this conviction. We affirm that the protection of truth is a matter of national security and that sovereignty over the information space must remain firmly in the hands of the Congolese government.

It is in this spirit that Sentinel has been conceived. It is not merely a technological platform but a strategic capability aligned with the mandate of the government. Its mission is to safeguard our discourse, shield our people from manipulation, and ensure that misinformation cannot distort our truth, divide our communities, or compromise our sovereignty.

Approach to the challenge

The response to these challenges must be as swift and coordinated as the threats themselves. Sentinel has been conceived to equip the Democratic Republic of Congo with the ability to observe and interpret the flow of information as it happens. By systematically monitoring the channels through which news and narratives circulate, it provides authorities with a comprehensive picture of what is being said, by whom, and with what potential impact. This capacity transforms the information space from a realm of uncertainty into one where the government can exercise oversight with clarity and purpose.

Beyond observation, Sentinel introduces an early-warning capability that allows decision-makers to recognize when harmful narratives begin to gain momentum. By detecting patterns of virality at their origin, it enables intervention before rumors escalate into crises that unsettle communities or undermine trust in institutions. In doing so, Sentinel ensures that leaders are not reacting after the damage has been done, but instead are positioned to act decisively and in advance. This shift from reaction to anticipation strengthens the resilience of the state and reinforces its sovereignty in the information domain.


Core Capabilities

Having established why the information domain represents a matter of national security, and how Sentinel is designed to provide oversight and early warning, it is now essential to outline the core capabilities that make this possible. Each capability has been conceived not as a technical function alone, but as a strategic instrument serving the sovereignty and stability of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Together, they form a unified system that allows government authorities to move from uncertainty to clarity, and from reaction to anticipation.

Comprehensive Monitoring

Sentinel’s first core capability is the ability to observe, in a systematic and continuous manner, the diverse channels through which information circulates. This includes traditional news outlets, digital platforms, and social media spaces where narratives often emerge and evolve. By consolidating these sources into a single view, government authorities gain a complete and uninterrupted picture of the information environment. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, this capability is particularly critical during sensitive periods such as elections, where false claims of polling station closures or manipulated results can appear suddenly and spread rapidly. Through comprehensive monitoring, the state is no longer reliant on fragmented reports but possesses its own independent lens over the national discourse.

Structured Analysis

Observation alone is insufficient without the ability to interpret what is being observed. Sentinel’s second capability is to transform raw data into structured insights that reveal the actors, narratives, and potential impacts behind circulating information. It highlights patterns of sentiment, identifies recurring themes, and distinguishes between ordinary discussion and coordinated attempts to mislead the public. For example, in times of conflict, when propaganda is pushed to suggest that cities have fallen or that communities are under imminent threat, structured analysis ensures that decision-makers understand both the origin and the intent of such claims. This turns scattered information into actionable knowledge, enabling leaders to grasp not only what is being said but why it matters.

Early Warning and Decision Support

The third capability of Sentinel lies in its ability to serve as an early-warning system. By detecting when harmful narratives begin to gain traction, it enables authorities to act before rumors escalate into crises. Instead of reacting once panic has already spread, leaders can intervene proactively with clarifications, counter-messaging, or security measures. This proactive stance is vital for public health as well: when misinformation about diseases or false cures begins to circulate, timely alerts allow government agencies to protect citizens before dangerous beliefs take hold. Through clear visualizations and structured alerts, Sentinel translates a complex and fast-moving information environment into decision-ready intelligence, thereby strengthening the state’s capacity to safeguard stability and uphold sovereignty


System Features

Sentinel has been designed as a comprehensive national capability. Its full suite of features extends far beyond basic monitoring and provides government authorities with the means to oversee, understand, and respond to information dynamics across every medium and channel. Each feature has been conceived not merely as a technical function, but as a strategic instrument serving the sovereignty and stability of the Democratic Republic of Congo. By presenting the full system and then defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), this section shows both the breadth of the vision and the practical first step required to make it a reality.


1. Multi-Source Monitoring

Sentinel’s foundation is its capacity to observe and ingest information from across the entire media ecosystem. This monitoring is not limited to one format but covers all the main forms through which narratives circulate in society. By doing so, the government gains oversight of the full spectrum of communication channels, ensuring that no rumor or campaign escapes detection.

Text
Includes twitter posts, online news articles, opinion pieces, blog posts, comments, and documents.
Why it matters: Written content often carries the first wave of narratives. In the DRC, false headlines about election outcomes or fabricated political statements can quickly influence public perception if left unchecked.

Images
Covers memes, infographics, doctored photos, and visual propaganda shared on social media.
Why it matters: Visual misinformation spreads faster than text because it is easy to share and emotionally impactful. An edited photograph of a ballot box or a fabricated health infographic can inflame distrust in institutions.

Videos
Includes news clips, livestreams, short-form videos, and forwards shared on platforms like TikTok, Youtube, Facebook, and WhatsApp.
Why it matters: Video combines imagery, sound, and narrative, making it one of the most persuasive forms of disinformation. Staged or decontextualized clips can create panic during conflict or health emergencies.

Audio
Includes podcasts, speeches, interviews,  and recorded voice notes.
Why it matters: False or misleading audio broadcasts can rapidly shape public opinion, especially where internet penetration is low.

2. Data Analysis

A structured process of examining collected information to identify sentiment, recurring topics, key actors, and trends.

It allows the government to distinguish between ordinary discussion and coordinated campaigns aimed at manipulation. For example, sudden spikes in negative sentiment about an election process can be flagged for immediate review.

3. Propagation & Influence Analysis

Tools to trace how information travels, who amplifies it, and what impact it creates.

It enables authorities to see not just the message, but also the network behind it. In times of conflict, this helps identify whether rumors are spreading organically or being pushed deliberately by organized groups.

4. Machine Learning & AI Modules

Predictive models that can forecast likely future narratives, detect unusual activity, and recognize repeating patterns of disinformation.

It provides foresight instead of hindsight. Detecting early signs of a coordinated rumor campaign allows intervention before it becomes widespread.

5. Counter-Response Module

A capability to organize and evaluate government responses to misinformation, including tracking how corrective messages perform.

It moves the government from passive monitoring to active engagement. Ensures that once a false claim is flagged, the state can respond quickly and measure its effectiveness.

6. Targeted Notification System

Priority alerting mechanism to deliver critical information to specific individuals or institutions.

it ensures that key decision-makers — whether in government, health agencies, or security — receive timely alerts when their intervention is required.

7. Data Visualisation

Dashboards, charts, maps, and timelines that transform raw information into an understandable format.

It provides leaders with a clear, real-time “command center” view of the information landscape, ensuring decisions are based on evidence, not fragments.

8. Search & Discovery

Tools to search across both live internet sources and Sentinel’s internal database, supported by semantic analysis.

It empowers officials to investigate claims rapidly and verify facts. For example, when a rumor emerges, analysts can instantly check whether similar narratives have appeared before and how they evolved.

9. Mobile Application

A simplified companion platform for accessing alerts and fact-checking tools on mobile devices.

It provides a direct channel between the government and its citizens, allowing the population to receive first-hand information from a reliable source. This strengthens public trust by ensuring that accurate, official messages reach people quickly, countering misinformation before it can take hold. It also ensures that timely communication is possible during elections, health crises, or security events.

10. Alert & Critical Event Module

Automated systems that generate alerts for breaking events, threats, or anomalies, with the ability to escalate based on severity.

It ensures that high-risk misinformation is not buried in data but surfaced immediately. This reduces the risk of delayed responses during national crises.

11. User Roles and Access

A secure system of role-based permissions that controls who can view, analyze, or act on information.

It protects sensitive national data, ensuring that only authorized officials can access certain intelligence, thereby maintaining trust and confidentiality.


MVP Scope

While the full system provides a wide array of advanced features, the immediate priority is to establish a baseline capability that delivers the most essential functions required today. The proposed Minimum Viable Product (MVP) includes the following modules:

Multi-Source Monitoring (initially focusing on text from key sources such as Twitter/X, Google News, and 7sur7.cd).
Data Analysis (sentiment detection and basic entity recognition).
Propagation & Influence Analysis (virality detection only).
Data Visualisation (foundational dashboards and charts).
Alert & Critical Event Module (alerts delivered within the Sentinel web interface).
User Roles and Access (basic role-based security for authorized officials).


Resource Requirements for MVP

The proposed investment of approximately $4.5 million for the MVP represents the minimum national capability required to secure the Democratic Republic of Congo’s information space. This is not a technology expense, but a strategic investment in sovereignty, stability, and national security.

Nearly half of this budget is dedicated directly to Congolese engineers and technical experts, who will build, integrate, and operate Sentinel. This ensures that knowledge and capacity remain in-country, creating high-skill employment and establishing a foundation of local expertise. The remainder of the funding covers essential API access to global platforms — Twitter, Meta, Google, YouTube — and the cloud infrastructure required to process and store petabytes of data securely and in real time.


Engineering & Operations (~$2.0M)

Core software development, integration, DevOps, AI/ML engineering, and knowledge transfer to government staff. This is the largest share of the budget, reflecting the principle that Sentinel is being built by Congolese engineers with global experience, drawing on knowledge from world-leading institutions while remaining rooted in national ownership. The engineering team — Congolese engineers, trained and tested at the highest international level — ensures that this capability is not outsourced but developed in-country, for the benefit of the Congolese people.

APIs and Data Access (~$1.2M)
	Enterprise access to Twitter/X, Google News providers, Meta Graph, YouTube Data API, and Google’s Gemini AI for text and multimedia analysis. These costs reflect the necessity of obtaining direct visibility into platforms where misinformation circulates.
Infrastructure & Compute (~$1.0M)
	Secure deployment on Google Cloud Platform (Africa region), optimized with tiered storage, spot compute, and managed Elasticsearch indexing. This enables Sentinel to ingest and analyze millions of records at national scale while keeping costs efficient.
Integration & Support (~$0.3M)
	Secure system deployment, compliance audits, and 24/7 operational support to ensure resilience from day one.

The price of inaction is far greater than the price of Sentinel. A single misinformation campaign can destabilize elections, fuel conflict, or spread dangerous health narratives. The economic and human cost of such crises can reach hundreds of millions of dollars. By comparison, an investment of $4.5M is modest insurance against threats that undermine national stability.
Equally important, this investment builds Congolese capacity. Nearly half of the budget supports the engineers who are building Sentinel — Congolese professionals with international-level expertise, trained and tested at the highest global standards, but committed to strengthening their homeland. This ensures that Sentinel is not just a tool but an institution, designed and owned by the Congolese state.
APIs and infrastructure are necessary enablers, giving the government visibility into platforms controlled abroad, but the control of the system itself remains Congolese. The project is therefore both a national security system and a capacity-building program — defending sovereignty while creating high-skill jobs, transferring knowledge, and anchoring advanced expertise in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This baseline is therefore not a pilot. It is the foundation of a long-term national program, which will scale to approximately $10 million over three years. Year 1 establishes the baseline, Year 2 expands multimedia analysis and dashboards, and Year 3 deploys predictive AI, counter-response tools, and a mobile application to communicate official information directly to citizens.

Impact and Benefits
The Sentinel program is not simply a digital project. It is a pillar of national security and governance. In today’s information age, the stability of the Democratic Republic of Congo no longer depends only on borders, armies, and resources — it also depends on the ability to control and defend the national narrative. A single rumor, tweet, or manipulated video can provoke unrest, weaken democratic legitimacy, or undermine public health. Sentinel is the state’s shield in this domain.
1. National Security and Sovereignty
Misinformation is not random. It is often organized, financed, and deployed with intent to destabilize. Without Sentinel, the Democratic Republic of Congo is effectively blind in the information battlefield, relying on foreign companies like Twitter, Meta, or Google to decide what the Congolese people see. Sentinel reverses this imbalance. It gives the state independent visibility and authority, ensuring that sovereignty in the information domain remains where it belongs — with the Congolese government.
Every dollar invested is an investment in preventing crises before they erupt:
Preventing electoral manipulation.
Preventing conflict fueled by false narratives.
Preventing health disasters caused by fake cures or rumors.
2. Citizen Trust and Communication
Governments live or die by legitimacy. Sentinel strengthens legitimacy by creating a direct channel between the state and its citizens. In future phases, the mobile application will allow every Congolese citizen to receive first-hand, official information directly from the government. This breaks the cycle of rumor and restores trust in institutions.
When citizens see that the government communicates clearly, promptly, and truthfully, their confidence in the state grows. In moments of crisis, this trust can mean the difference between unrest and stability.
3. Economic and Capacity Impact
Unlike foreign software contracts, Sentinel keeps the majority of investment in-country. Nearly half of the MVP cost — and the majority of the long-term $10M program — is directed to Congolese engineers and professionals.
Jobs: Over three years, Sentinel will create more than 70 high-skill jobs for Congolese professionals.
Knowledge: Our engineers, trained and tested at world-leading institutions, are applying their expertise directly to strengthen national capacity.
Future-proofing: Skills in AI, data science, and information security will remain in the country long after the initial project.
4. Regional Leadership
With Sentinel, the Democratic Republic of Congo will not simply protect itself. It will become a continental leader in information sovereignty. Few African nations today possess the ability to independently monitor and control their information space. By Year Three, DRC will not only protect its own citizens but will be in a position to set the agenda regionally, supporting neighbors and shaping Africa’s digital security policies.
In a world where narratives decide legitimacy, Sentinel ensures that the DRC is not a follower, but a leader.
